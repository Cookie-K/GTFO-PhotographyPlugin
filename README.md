## Plugin Menu
Pressing `F4` will open the following menu: 

![Plugin Menu](https://i.imgur.com/8Shl0iB.png)

1. `Free Camera`: The main tool of the plugin. Strips the entire UI and FPS effects off the screen and enters the player into free camera mode. You cannot interact with anything while in this state and the player will return to where they started free cam when exiting (the world may be gone when you exit but just walk and the culler should update).

    When entering free cam, the UI, Body, and FPS look smoothing options are disabled. The free cam option it self will also be disabled too if everyone else in the lobby is already in free cam.

    `Enemies`: Free cam does not hard aggro enemies but if you are in Free Cam with enemies already aggroed to you, enemies will attack the spot where you entered Free Cam (it will look kind of awkward...). In multiplayer, not everyone can be in Free Cam at the same time to avoid this issue. There must be at least one player who is not in free cam such that there is always somebody that the plugin can divert enemies to. 

    `Team Scans`: When a player is in free cam team scans will temporarily reduce the required members down so you can still complete them without the free cam player. The HUD won't update but you will still need all your non free cam players for it to progress. (For Bots, they do not have the intelligence to do scans on their own so this is only for use with real people)
  
    `Controls`:
    - `WASD`: move camera forward, backward, left, and right.
    - `space`: move up
    - `left ctrl`: move down
    - `left shift`: speed up (x2)
    - `left alt`: slow down (x1/2)
    - `left click`: roll counter clock wise
    - `right click`: roll clock wise
    - `scroll wheel forward`: zoom in
    - `scroll wheel back`: zoom out
    - `middle click`: reset camera roll and zoom

    Do take a look at the config file if you want to change some of these keybinds.

    Use the various sliders for movement, rotation, and zoom to adjust speed and smoothing weight to your liking.
    - `Dynamic Roll`: Rolls the camera in proportion to the camera's horizontal velocity. Gives a kind of FPV drone type feel.
    - `Align Pitch Axis w/ Cam`: Aligns the camera's axis of forwards and backwards movement with the camera's pitch. It's like the G-Mod no-clip controls when on and like the Minecraft creative controls when off.
    - `Align Roll Axis w/ Cam`: Aligns the camera's axis of left and right movement with the camera's roll. When turned off the camera's horizontal movement will be parallel to the horizon regardless of camera roll. When turned on, moving left and right will move the camera along the camera's rolled axis.
    - `Hide Targeting Text`: Hide the targeting text that highlights what agent to focus on when using `C`
    - `Edit Spot Light`: Edit the spotlight settings while in free cam. Range, Intensity, and Angle can be set.
    - `Edit Ambient Light`: Edit the ambient light that emits from your character. Range and Intensity can be set.

2. `Body`: Hides the body from the camera (arms and legs)
3. `UI`: Strip the UI of UI elements
    - `Toggle Bio`: Toggle ON to see the bio pings even if UI is turned off
4. `Aspect Ratio`: Add black bars to top and bottom of the screen to adjust the aspect ratio  
5. `FPS Look Smoothing`: Smooths the FPS camera movements for use outside of free cam
6. `DoF`: Adjusts the depth of field of the camera to get the blur effect on the foreground. (Unfortunately there seems to be a bug with how post processing is taken care of in R7's new pipeline such that the background can no longer be blurred. As of V 1.2.0 this setting can only blur the foreground)

7. `Vignette`: turns the camera's vignette on/off 
8. `Ambient Particles`: turns off the ambient particles that are floating around the map
9. `Time Scale`: Changes the time scale of the game (the gifs below are showing the in game speed and are not edited down). Only one person at a time can change the time scale (the option will be disabled for those who are not controlling time). Additionally you can use the key binds `Q` `E` & `R` to slow, speed up, and pause/play time.

## Targeting Cam

The targeting camera can be used to follow an agent (player or enemy) around in a third person perspective. While in free cam press `C` and look at the agent you want to target and let go of the key to enter the targeting camera mode.

`Controls`:
- `C`: Enter/exit targeting mode
- `wasd`: Adjust center of orbit
- `LMB`: Toggle rotation lock

*It should be noted that if the time scale is set to its minimum, the targeting select lags behind a bit as well. Increase the time scale just a little bit to make it select faster if needed.

### Building from source

Copy the `BepInEx` folder from a r2mm profile with the `BepInExPack_GTFO` mod installed, *that has been fully started at least once*, into the `lib` folder.

To automatically copy the plugin into your r2mm profile of choice,
add a file called `CinematographyPlugin.csproj.user` next to the existing `CinematographyPlugin.csproj` file and add the following contents
with the path to your profile set:
```xml
<Project>
    <PropertyGroup>
        <ProfilePath>%appdata%\r2modmanPlus-local\GTFO\profiles\VanillaTesting</ProfilePath>
    </PropertyGroup>
</Project>
```
